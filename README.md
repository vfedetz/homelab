# üè† Homelab

![Homepage](assets/homepage.png)


The purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun - where I can try out and experiment with technology.

This repository serves as a collection of Docker/container configurations, utilities, and automation scripts used to manage and orchestrate various services within my homelab environment. Each service has its own directory containing a docker-compose.yml file and any necessary supporting files (e.g., environment variables).

Feel free to explore, use, and modify these files to suit your own homelab needs!

## Introduction
This repository aims to simplify the setup and management of containerized services in a homelab environment using Docker-Compose. Each service is defined in a separate Docker-Compose file, making it easy to start, stop, and configure as needed.
